# Internet-of-Things
**what is the Internet of Things (IoT)?**\
IoT refers to Things around us are connected to each other and performing intelligent actions.\
simple and interactive things
- Can ***sense*** their surroundings
- Can ***talk*** to other things
- Can ***act intelligently***

**How do things turn into smart things and achieve connectivity & intelligence?**
### DNA of IoT
**Devices** --> To sense the surroundings.\
**Network** --> To talk to other things.\
**Applications** --> To act intelligently.

### Devices
Building blocks of an IoT Device
- Sensors + Actuators
- Power
- Processing(MCU)
- Communication
- Firmware

In IoT Devices major component is Sensors.\
**Sensors**

Sensing element of an IoT Device
- Can detect changes in its environment.
- Slighest changes that even humans cannot perceive.

**Types of Sensors**

Proximity Sensor
- Detects the presence of a nearby object

Light Sensor
- Senses the intensity of light

PIR Sensor
- Detects radiant heat reflected from objects.
- Used for human presense detection.

Temperature Sensor
- Measures temperature levels & changes.\

and many more...

**How Smart Things Sense?**

Sensor based IoT Devices embedded into Physical Things Around you.\
Can be embedded into your Gadgets, Electrical appliances, Vehicals, Traffic lights & almost anything we can come across.

**Advanced Sensors**.\
Pulse sensors, Flex sensors, Inertial Measurement Unit, Galvanic sensors, Electro-Encephalographic (EEG) sensors, Biodegradable sensors and many more...

**Sensors in smart phones**\
Proximity sensors: Auto turn-off screen near ear.\
Ambient Light sensor: Auto-Brightness feature.\
Accelerometer + Gyroscope: Fitness Apps for step count.\
and many more...
- Smartphones has around 16 different sensors.
- McLaren's Formula-1 car has over 300 sensors.

To make these devices work we need to software which is Firmware.
- Assembly Language, C/Embedded C, C++, MicroPython, Python and many more...
### Network
**Wireless Communication**

Enabling Things to communicate
- Bluetooth/BLE, WiFi, 4G/5G, LPWANs/LoRaWAN, etc.

### Applications
**Building Intelligence from Devices**
- Having or selecting preferences of users on how or when devices should work.
- Application giving suggestions to user based on information received from sensors.
